# All materials for this course
Her you will find all project resources needed to go through the course.

## A word on styling
You have the option to skip the videos around the styling, if you're mainly here for learning about SvelteKit.
If you want to do that you can simply download the starter templates repository from github: [Starter Templates](https://github.com/Nickfis/svelte5-course-starter-templates)

They include all styling as well as image assets. Otherwise, they are completely blank. In the video "Optional: In case you do not want to write any CSS," I'll show you exactly how you can work with the starter templates.

## Google Fonts
In all projects, we'll be using Google Fonts. For that, I added the `app.html` file for every project, that includes the necessary stylesheets and imports.
